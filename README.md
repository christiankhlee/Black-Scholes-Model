## How It Works
The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model application allows users to calculate the theoretical value of call and put options based on the Black-Scholes formula. Users can input various parameters such as the current stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, and expiration date to generate option values and key risk metrics. 

The app also provides real-time profit and loss (PnL) calculations based on initial purchase prices, as well as break-even analysis to help traders and investors make informed decisions. Additionally, interactive heatmaps allow users to explore how option prices and PnL change under different conditions.

## Usage
1. Enter **current stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, and expiration date**.
2. Enter **purchase price** if tracking PnL for an existing option.
3. View **calculated call & put values, risk metrics, and profit/loss (PnL)**.
4. Explore **heatmaps** showing option price & PnL under different conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **Streamlit**  (for UI & interactivity)
- **NumPy**  (for numerical calculations)
- **SciPy**  (for normal distribution functions)
- **Plotly / Seaborn**  (for visualizations)
